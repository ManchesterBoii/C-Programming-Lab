# C++ Programming Lab
CS 106L: Standard C++ Programming Laboratory
This class explores features of the C++ programming language beyond what's covered in CS106B. Topics include core C++ language features (e.g. const-correctness, operator overloading, templates, move semantics, and lambda expressions) and standard libraries (e.g. containers, algorithms, and smart pointers). Pre- or corequisite: CS106B or equivalent. Prerequisite: CS106B or equivalent
